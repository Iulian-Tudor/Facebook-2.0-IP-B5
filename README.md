A fork of a group project I worked on for the subject of [Software Engineering] while in second year of college. The project assigned to us was a social media platform that would have all basic functionalities of such a web app, including an ad recommendation system based on user conversations and posts. We made use of the Scram methodolody in order to develop the application. The project was realized by my group, consisting of 18 students over the span of 1 and a half months.

Some of the technologies used are:

* MySQL Database
* Docker
* Cloudflare images
* Java Spring
* React
* The natural language parser from Stenford

More can be read in the technical report in the main branch.
